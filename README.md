# Haensel-AMS-Challenge

Here is my turn on the data challenge. An interesting challenge where I could explore and demonstrate my skills.
I did a complete write-up to give insight into my working process in the PDF. 

note. the python files are coming from jupyter. the structure is not object-orientated.
Please refer to my other github projects to find prove of my skills to do so.
