# Haensel-AMS-Challenge

Here is my turn on the data challenge. An interesting challenge where I could explore and demonstrate my skills.
I did a complete write-up to give insight into my working process in the [PDF](https://github.com/joppevos/Haensel-AMS-Challenge/blob/master/Challenge_JoppeVos.pdf). 

#### note. 
The python files are coming from jupyter. The overal structure is not object-oriented since it was an exploration.
Please refer to my other github projects to find prove of my skills to do so.
